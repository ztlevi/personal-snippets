The Bootstrap grid system has four classes:

- `xs` (for phones - screens less than 768px wide)
- `sm` (for tablets - screens equal to or greater than 768px wide)
- `md` (for small laptops - screens equal to or greater than 992px wide)
- `lg` (for laptops and desktops - screens equal to or greater than 1200px wide)

The classes above can be combined to create more dynamic and flexible layouts.
