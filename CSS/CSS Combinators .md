A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator.

There are four different combinators in CSS:

- descendant selector (space)
- child selector (>)
- adjacent sibling selector (+)
- general sibling selector (~)

# Descendant Selector

The descendant selector matches all elements that are descendants of a specified element.

# Child Selector

The child selector selects all elements that are the immediate children of a specified element.

# Adjacent Sibling Selector

The adjacent sibling selector selects all elements that are the adjacent siblings of a specified element.

Sibling elements must have the same parent element, and "adjacent" means "immediately following".

# General Sibling Selector

The general sibling selector selects all elements that are siblings of a specified element.
