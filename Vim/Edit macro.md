If the missing part should land at the very end, press <kbd>Qq</kbd>, add the missing part and stop recording as usual,
by pressing q.

If you need to fine-tune the whole macro, print it with <kbd>"qp</kbd>, edit and put it back to the q register with, for
example: <kbd>"qyy</kbd> or select the text first and then <kbd>"qy</kbd>
