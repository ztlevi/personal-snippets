# https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-transaction-fee/description/

Your are given an array of integers prices, for which the i-th element is the price of a given stock on day i; and a
non-negative integer fee representing a transaction fee.

You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction. You may
not buy more than 1 share of a stock at a time (ie. you must sell the stock share before you buy again.)

Return the maximum profit you can make.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, prices, fee):
        """
        :type prices: List[int]
        :type fee: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        l = len(prices)
        hold = [0] * l
        notHold = [0] * l
        hold[0] = -prices[0]

        for i in range(1, l):
            hold[i] = max(hold[i-1], notHold[i-1] - prices[i])
            notHold[i] = max(notHold[i-1], hold[i-1] - fee + prices[i])
        return notHold[l-1]
```
