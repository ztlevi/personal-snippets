Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most k transactions.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).

```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, k, prices):
        """
        :type k: int
        :type prices: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not prices or not k:
            return 0
        if k > len(prices) // 2:
            return self.quickSolution(prices)
        l = len(prices)
        hold = [[0 for _ in range(l)] for _ in range(k+1)]
        sell = [[0 for _ in range(l)] for _ in range(k+1)]

        for i in range(1, k+1):
            hold[i][0] = -prices[0]
            for j in range(1, l):
                p = prices[j]
                sell[i][j] = max(sell[i][j-1], hold[i][j-1] + p)
                hold[i][j] = max(hold[i][j-1], sell[i-1][j-1] - p)

        return sell[k][l-1]

    def quickSolution(self, prices):
        res = 0
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            if prices[i] > prices[i-1]:
                res += prices[i] - prices[i-1]
        return res
```
