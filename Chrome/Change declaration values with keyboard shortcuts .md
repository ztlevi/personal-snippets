While editing the value of a declaration, you can use the following keyboard shortcuts to increment
the value by a fixed amount:

- Option+Up (Mac) or Alt+Up (Windows, Linux) to increment by 0.1.
- Up to change the value by 1, or by 0.1 if the current value is between -1 and 1.
- Shift+Up to increment by 10.
- Shift+Command+Up (Mac) or Shift+Page Up (Windows, Linux) to increment the value by 100.

Decrementing also works. Just replace each instance of Up mentioned above with Down.
