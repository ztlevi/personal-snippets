## There are 7 basic types in JavaScript.

- number for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point.
- string for strings. A string may have one or more characters, there’s no separate single-character type.
- boolean for true/false.
- null for unknown values – a standalone type that has a single value null.
- undefined for unassigned values – a standalone type that has a single value undefined.
- object for more complex data structures.
- symbol for unique identifiers.

The typeof operator allows us to see which type is stored in the variable.

- Two forms: typeof x or typeof(x).
- Returns a string with the name of the type, like "string".
- For null returns "object" – that’s an error in the language, it’s not an object in fact.

In the next chapters we’ll concentrate on primitive values and once we’re familiar with them, then we’ll move on to
objects.
