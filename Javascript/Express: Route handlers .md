# Route handlers

You can provide multiple callback functions that behave like middleware to handle a request. The only exception is that
these callbacks might invoke next('route') to bypass the remaining route callbacks. You can use this mechanism to impose
pre-conditions on a route, then pass control to subsequent routes if thereâ€™s no reason to proceed with the current
route.

Route handlers can be in the form of a function, an array of functions, or combinations of both, as shown in the
following examples.

A single callback function can handle a route. For example:

```js
app.get("/example/a", function(req, res) {
  res.send("Hello from A!");
});
```

More than one callback function can handle a route (make sure you specify the next object). For example:

```js
app.get(
  "/example/b",
  function(req, res, next) {
    console.log("the response will be sent by the next function ...");
    next();
  },
  function(req, res) {
    res.send("Hello from B!");
  }
);
```

An array of callback functions can handle a route. For example:

```js
var cb0 = function(req, res, next) {
  console.log("CB0");
  next();
};

var cb1 = function(req, res, next) {
  console.log("CB1");
  next();
};

var cb2 = function(req, res) {
  res.send("Hello from C!");
};

app.get("/example/c", [cb0, cb1, cb2]);
```

A combination of independent functions and arrays of functions can handle a route. For example:

```js
var cb0 = function(req, res, next) {
  console.log("CB0");
  next();
};

var cb1 = function(req, res, next) {
  console.log("CB1");
  next();
};

app.get(
  "/example/d",
  [cb0, cb1],
  function(req, res, next) {
    console.log("the response will be sent by the next function ...");
    next();
  },
  function(req, res) {
    res.send("Hello from D!");
  }
);
```
