The fundamentals of the Pomodoro Technique are simple yet incredibly effective.

1. Choose a task you'd like to get done Something big, something small, something you’ve been
   putting off for a million years: it doesn’t matter. What matters is that it’s something that
   deserves your full, undivided attention.

2. Set the Pomodoro for 25 minutes Make a small oath to yourself: I will spend 25 minutes on this
   task and I will not interrupt myself. You can do it! After all, it’s just 25 minutes.

3. Work on the task until the Pomodoro rings Immerse yourself in the task for the next 25 minutes.
   If you suddenly realize you have something else you need to do, write the task down on a sheet of
   paper.

4. When the Pomodoro rings, put a checkmark on a paper Congratulations! You’ve spent an entire,
   interruption-less Pomodoro on a task.

5. Take a short break on a paper Breathe, meditate, grab a cup of coffee, go for a short walk or do
   something else relaxing (i.e., not work-related). Your brain will thank you later.

6) Every 4 pomodoros, take a longer break on a paper Once you’ve completed four pomodoros, you can
   take a longer break. 20 minutes is good. Or 30. Your brain will use this time to assimilate new
   information and rest before the next round of Pomodoros.

# How The Pomodoro will change you

The Pomodoro Technique isn’t just about helping you get things done today; it’s about learning how
you work so you can save time in the future.

1. Find out how much effort an activity requires Ever wonder where all your time goes? Wonder no
   more: it’s all on the page. Your Pomodoro To-Do sheet is a visual overview of the time you’ve
   spent on various tasks.

2. Cut down on interruptions Usually, you can afford to take 25 minutes before calling back a friend
   or replying to an email. You’ll learn how to handle the inevitable interruption while staying
   focused on the task at hand.

3. Estimate the effort for activities Once you’ve gotten the hang of the technique, you’ll be able
   to accurately predict how many Pomodoros it will take to accomplish tomorrow’s -- or next month’s
   -- tasks.

4. Make the Pomodoro more effective While the contours of the Pomodoro are set, what you do within
   them can be adjusted to maximize efficiency. One way to make a Pomodoro more effective is to use
   the first few minutes to review what you’ve done before. Other methods are discussed in the book.

5. Set up a timetable A timetable sets a limit, motivating you to complete a task within a set
   period of time. It also delineates your work time from your free time. Creating a clear timetable
   will allow you to enjoy your time off without worrying that you could be doing more work.

6. Define your own objectives The Pomodoro Technique is a tool you can use to reach your own
   objectives. For example, a writer might realize he’s spending too much time revising, and adjust
   his Pomodoro timetable to allow for more brainstorming time.
